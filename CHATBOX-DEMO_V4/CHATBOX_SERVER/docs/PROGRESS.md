# Progress Log

Running record of what was **tried**, what **worked**, and what **didn't work / was fixed** — one entry
per commit, newest first. Companion to `RND_KG_Companion_System.md` (the design report). Kept so the
research write-up can reference which approaches were attempted and why.

## feat: auto-consolidate every 3 conversations + Feature-2d category colours  *(branch `KG-knowledge-extraction`)*

**Tried:** (1) auto-run topic consolidation every 3 conversations at end-of-session; (2) Feature-2d — colour
topic nodes in the viz by their category.
**Worked:**
- `_maybe_auto_consolidate()` runs inside `_extract_session` after extraction: counts total SessionNodes in
  the graph (persists across runs) and, when `count % 3 == 0`, applies `consolidate_topics` (merges). Verified
  it fires only at 3, 6, … and is a no-op without embeddings. **Design change (user-approved):** consolidation
  is no longer strictly manual — it auto-applies every 3rd conversation; the standalone `--mode consolidate`
  and `C` preview still exist.
- 2d: viz server now emits `category` on topic nodes; `index.html` tints each Topic diamond by a 10-colour
  category palette (`CATEGORY_COLOR`) and adds a "Topic category → fill" legend. Live-updates when a topic's
  category changes. HTML well-formed; transform emits category (existing topics show `other` until re-typed).
**Note:** old topics created before Feature-1 are all `category=other` (grey) until a new extraction types
them — expected.
**Didn't / deferred:** 2c topic↔topic relations; rapport/trust (still parked).

## feat(kg): Feature-2 semantic topic consolidation (2a + 2b)  *(branch `KG-knowledge-extraction`)*

**Tried:** merge near-duplicate topics that exact-label reuse can't catch ("hiphop"/"hip hop",
"football"/"soccer"). **2a (pure, graph_relationship):** `merge_topics(canonical, duplicate)` — redirect all
incident edges onto the canonical, union notes (+ `merged_from` marker), upgrade category only if canonical
was `other`, delete the duplicate; plus `topic_degree()` and a new pure `store.delete_node()`.
**2b (app layer, kg_extraction):** `consolidate_topics(store, embed_fn, floor=0.86, same_category_only=True,
dry_run=False)` — embed each label, pair by cosine ≥ floor, union-find groups, canonical = highest degree
(tie → shortest, then lexicographic), call the pure merge. Triggers: standalone `--mode consolidate`
(+`--dry-run`, `--merge-floor`) and an in-window `C` hotkey (dry-run preview only). **Approved scope: 2a+2b
only** — topic↔topic relations (2c) and category viz grouping (2d) deferred.
**Worked (verified, fake embed_fn):** dry-run proposes merges and writes nothing; apply merges the two
near-dup pairs, keeps distinct "jazz", 5→3 topics; canonical picks the shorter label; notes unioned with
`merged_from`; **idempotent** re-run (no further merges); **cross-category never merges** even at high
similarity; save/load round-trips; `graph_relationship/` stays free of LLM/PAD/app imports.
**Decisions:** hard-merge (redirect + delete) not alias; consolidation is **manual/reviewable**, never
auto-run during live extraction; merge floor 0.86 (stricter than the 0.62 capability floor); `C` is
preview-only (apply via `--mode consolidate`).
**Didn't / deferred:** topic↔topic relations, clustering, category-based viz grouping (revisit after this),
and any change to rapport/trust (still deferred).

## feat(kg): fine-grained topic typing + graph-aware extraction  *(branch `KG-knowledge-extraction`)*

**Tried:** two improvements to LLM knowledge extraction. **Step 1** — `TopicNode` gains a `category` from a
CLOSED taxonomy (`TopicCategory`: music/science/animals/food/activity/place/person/media/sport/other).
**Step 2** — condition the extraction prompt on the person's *existing* topics so the LLM reuses established
nodes; output splits into `existing_topics_discussed` vs `new_topics`. Kept decoupling: all LLM/prompt/guard
logic in the new APP module `modules/kg_extraction.py`; `graph_relationship/` gained only pure helpers.
**Worked (all verification points):**
- category enum defined once; **TopicNode id stays label-only** (category is an attribute, not identity —
  two extractions disagreeing on category resolve to the SAME node).
- backward-compat: old `kg_state.json` untyped topics load and default to `other` (real file: 14 topics).
- graph-aware reuse: with "jazz" known, a transcript saying "jazz music" lands in
  `existing_topics_discussed` and creates **no** second node (before==after counts).
- new topic ("dinosaurs") → one typed `TopicNode(animals)` wired via the Interest layer (category→interest).
- guards write **nothing** on: malformed JSON (whole extraction discarded), invalid category (dropped),
  hallucinated "existing" not in the provided list (dropped), confidence < 0.6 (dropped).
- idempotent: re-running identical extraction gives identical node/edge counts.
- category round-trips through save→load→save; `graph_relationship/` has **zero** LLM/PAD imports.
**Decisions / deviations (flagged):**
- Invalid category → **drop** the item (not coerce), so "nothing written" holds for bad output.
- Closeness (rapport/trust) kept working by reusing the existing pure `extract()` for **deltas only** +
  the untouched `adjust_closeness` (its interest logic is not used). Closeness logic itself untouched.
- New/existing topics wire under an Interest named after the **category** (`person→Interest(category)→Topic`).
- `resolve_topic(category)` only fills a category when the node is still `other` (first non-other wins;
  TopicNode has no provenance field, so a conflict is not persisted — kept, not merged).
- Capability↔topic auto-linking (old embedding matcher path) is **not** run in the new topic extraction —
  embeddings/merge are explicitly out of scope for this step.
**Didn't / deferred:** embeddings, fuzzy/semantic merge, topic↔topic relations, clustering (Feature-2).

## docs: R&D system report + progress log

**Tried:** wrote a detailed R&D report (`RND_KG_Companion_System.md`) covering face-reco, emotion, the
FAST/SLOW/RELATIONSHIP graph, extraction, prompt structure, and pipeline; started this progress log.
**Worked:** report captures the current baseline (PAD disabled, emotion→mood only) accurately.
**Didn't / open:** no evaluation numbers yet; references + abstract still to add.
**Next:** improve the knowledge-extraction method (see report §7).

## `a31f30a` feat(viz): colour edges per person; chatbox edges blue

**Tried:** colour each person's edges with a distinct hue, shaded by timescale (FAST lighter / SLOW
darker), and force all robot (chatbox) edges to a single blue. Edge ownership inferred from the source
node id (`person` / `interest:` / `conversation:` / `interaction:` / `*:capability` / robot).
**Worked:** verified on the live graph — jay's 31 edges → jay hue, HJ's 10 → HJ hue, chatbox's 8 → blue,
0 unowned. Legend lists each person's colour dynamically.
**Didn't / watch:** blue is reserved for the robot and excluded from the person palette; if many people
are added the 8-colour palette will wrap (acceptable for now).

## `d093e00` feat(viz): Obsidian-style force sliders

**Tried:** top-right panel with live sliders — Repel (charge), Link length (distance), Link force
(strength), Center gravity (forceX/Y) — plus reset.
**Worked:** sliders drive the d3 sim live; centre-gravity re-centres on window resize; HTML well-formed.
**Didn't:** —

## `8eedb5f` feat: live conversation-status node + emotion/mood-aware prompt

**Tried:** (a) live "current topic" tracking; (b) emotion → FAST mood; (c) restructured, retrieval-augmented
prompt with affect.
**Worked:**
- Dedicated `ConversationNode` (rolling last-3 topic keywords + mood + emotion, linked to person **and**
  robot) — updates in place, verified via unit check.
- Prompt rebuilt into 3 blocks (IDENTITY / HOW TO REPLY / WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO); **dual affect signal**
  (mood valence in context + emotion label tagged on the current user turn); memory capped (top-4
  interests, ≤3 topics each, 3 recent notes one-per-topic).
- Raised embedding matcher floor 0.50 → 0.62.
**Didn't work → fixed (found during live testing):**
- *Save spam* returned once emotion was on — the raw detector valence jitters and kept tripping the
  0.04 dirty-gate. Fixed by widening the gate (save only on emotion-label change or ≥0.15 valence shift).
- *Spurious capability link* `tennis ↔ "good at math"`: the first design reused shared `TopicNode`s for
  the current topic, so the extraction embedding matcher attached bogus `about` edges. Root-caused and
  replaced with the dedicated `ConversationNode` (structurally cannot receive capability edges).
- *Accumulated artifacts*: one-time cleanup script purged old `current_topic` edges, orphaned
  current-topic topics, and non-keyword capability→topic links from `kg_state.json` (backup kept).
**Note:** `CurrentTopicEdge`/`set_current_topic` are now dead (kept in schema, unused).

## `aaa402d` feat: integrate webcam face-reco with the KG conversation pipeline

**Tried:** wire `webcam_loop` into the `graph_relationship` KG — recognize → retrieve into the prompt →
record turns → end-of-session extraction → update graph. PAD + emotion disabled by default; embedding
matcher default on.
**Worked:** full loop verified with a headless fake-LLM smoke test (seed → session → turns → extract →
graph update); seeds robot/human subgraphs from `specs/` on startup; retrieves interests / shared topics /
notes into the system prompt; records real turns onto `SessionNode.turns`.
**Didn't work → fixed:**
- *Crash on quit* `'Event' object is not callable`: `_DetectionWorker` stored its stop flag as
  `self._stop`, shadowing `threading.Thread._stop` (called by `join()`); surfaced once emotion was
  disabled and the worker finished fast. Renamed to `_stop_evt`.
- *Save spam* (identical snapshots each tick): added dirty-gating so KG-only ticks don't rewrite
  unchanged graphs.
